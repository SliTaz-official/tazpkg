Installation
------------
To install all needed files and compile translated messages, make and gettext
must be installed. Running 'make install' will install everything in /usr, but
another path and/or destination can be specified via PREFIX and DESTDIR.
Example:

	$ make DESTDIR=$PWD/_pkg install

Uninstall
---------
Simply type:
	
	$ make uninstall	

Translation
-----------	
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazpkg.pot

To update all translations from the pot file:

	$ make msgmerge

To compile po files for testing purposes you can use 'make msgfmt' or manually 
compile your translation. Example for french locale, note that the file must be 
copied into /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES so gettext can find it:

	$ msgfmt -o tazpkg.mo fr.po

README for TazPkg -  Tiny autonomous packages manager
===============================================================================


TazPkg is a small but powerful packages manager for SliTaz GNU/Linux and
other UNIX-like operating systems. It uses a *.tazpkg package generally built 
by Tazwok with a receipt found in the wok. More information can be found in 
the SliTaz Cookbook and the manual.

TazPkg is entirely built from scratch using SHell script; compatible with
Bash, it runs under Ash - part of the Busybox project. TazPkg is distributed
under the free GNU license GPL V3.

Installation
------------
To install all needed files and compile translated messages, make and gettext
must be installed. Running 'make install' will install everything in /usr, but
another path and/or destination can be specified via PREFIX and DESTDIR.
Example:

	$ make DESTDIR=$PWD/_pkg install

Uninstall
---------
Simply type:
	
	$ make uninstall	

Translation
-----------	
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazpkg.pot

To update all translations from the pot file:

	$ make msgmerge

To compile po files for testing purposes you can use 'make msgfmt' or manually 
compile your translation. Example for french locale, note that the file must be 
copied into /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES so gettext can find it:

	$ msgfmt -o tazpkg.mo fr.po

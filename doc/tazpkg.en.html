<h2>NAME</h2>

<p>
	Tazpkg—Tiny autonomous zone package manager
</p>


<h2>SYNTAX</h2>

<pre>
 tazpkg [command] [package|dir|pattern|list|cat|--opt] [dir|--opt]
</pre>


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
Tazpkg is an ultralightweight (~ 80KB) package manager to
install, list, download, update or remove precompiled packages
on a GNU/Linux system. Tazpkg offers commands for searching
and creating packages and was created independently for the project.
The format of the packages using the *.tazpkg extension is a
cpio archive containing a filesystem compressed with gzip,
a receipt and an optional description. Tazpkg also manages
dependencies based on package receipts. Each receipt contains
all the information about a package and can also include
pre and post installation functions. The same receipt is 
used by Cookutils to compile sources and generate a .tazpkg 
package.
</p>
<p>
Tazpkg is entirely built from scratch using SHell script, 
compatible with Bash; it runs under Ash—part of the Busybox 
project. Tazpkg is distributed under the free GNU license GPL V3. 
</p>


<h2>COMMANDS</h2>


<h3 id="list">list</h3>

<p>
List packages installed on the system. This command displays 
a column list of all installed packages, It also allows you to list the 
categories, packages based on category and packages placed on hold.
You can also use the <tt><a href="#search">search</a></tt> command
for a list based on a term or package name:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg list
# tazpkg list cat|<em>categories</em>
# tazpkg list blocked
</pre>


<h3 id="xhtml-list">xhtml-list</h3>

<p>
The <tt>xhtml-list</tt> command can create a XHTML list
of all the packages installed on the system which can be read
with your preferred Web browser. It can be run as a normal
user and creates a page <tt>installed-packages.html</tt> in
your current directory. Note that you can change the name of the
generated list via the command line:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg xhtml-list
# tazpkg xhtml-list <em>list-name.html</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="list-mirror">list-mirror</h3>

<p>
List packages available on the mirror. This command will
display the <tt>packages.list</tt> file recharged from the mirror.
If this doesn't exist, you will be asked to launch
<code>tazpkg <a href="#recharge">recharge</a></code> as administrator (root)
for a list of available packages . The <tt>--diff</tt> option is used to display
the differences between the last and current list of packages:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg list-mirror
# tazpkg list-mirror --diff
</pre>


<h3 id="info">info</h3>

<p>
Display any information available in the receipt for the 
package in question—its version, category, maintainer,
Web site and any dependencies (see also Cookutils for more
information on receipts):
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg info <em>busybox</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="desc">desc</h3>

<p>
Description of the package (if it exists). This command
displays the <tt>description.txt</tt> file of each package (a simple
text file, justified to 80 characters to fit in a standard terminal):
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg desc <em>busybox</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="list-config">list-config</h3>

<p>
Lists the system configuration files. The <tt>--box</tt> option displays
in table format:
</p>
<pre># tazpkg list-config
# tazpkg list-config --box
</pre>


<h3 id="list-files">list-files</h3>

<p>
List all files installed with a package. This command will
simply read and display the <tt>files.list</tt> of each package which is
automatically generated when the package is created and is
also used to remove files when uninstalling a package.
To list the files installed with the package bc:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg list-files <em>bc</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="search">search</h3>

<p>
Search for packages by owner or package name. This command
will search for the term wanted in the installed packages and the
list of available packages on the mirror. To obtain the 
latest list of installable packages on the mirror, just
run <code>tazpkg recharge</code> before conducting a search:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg search <em>gcc</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="search-file">search-file</h3>

<p>
The <tt>search-file</tt> command allows you to search for a file
among the files installed by the packages. This command is very
useful to find the full path to a file and determine if 
a file is present on the system. Example:
</p>
<pre>
 $ tazpkg search-file <em>libnss</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="install">install</h3>

<p>
This command allows the installation of a local package with
the <tt>.tazpkg</tt> extension. See
<tt><a href="#get-install">get-install</a></tt> to install a 
package from the internet. Note that you can force the
installation via the <tt>--forced</tt>, <tt>uninstall</tt> and
<tt>reinstall</tt> options 
or specify the root system where you want to install the
packages via the <tt>--root=</tt> option:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg install <em>package-1.0.tazpkg</em>
# tazpkg install <em>path/to/package-1.0.tazpkg</em> --forced
# tazpkg install <em>path/to/package-1.0.tazpkg</em> --root=<em>/mnt/rootfs</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="install-list">install-list or get-install-list</h3>
<p>
Install a set of packages listed in a file. This command
allows you to (download and) install several packages with a single command
and can also be forced:
</p>
<pre># tazpkg install-list <em>my-packages.list</em>
# tazpkg get-install-list <em>my-packages.list</em> --forced
</pre>


<h3 id="link">link</h3>

<p>
This command allows the installation of a package from another media 
device. The set up is done through symbolic links and consumes very little 
memory. It is generally used within the system RAM to install add-ons 
from an USB key:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg link <em>openoffice /media/usbdisk</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="remove">remove</h3>

<p>
Remove a package. You will be asked for confirmation (y/N).
This command will delete all files installed with the package.
To view the list of files, use the <tt><a href="#list-files">list-files</a></tt>
command followed by the name of the package. Example
with the package bc:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg remove <em>bc</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="extract">extract</h3>

<p>
Extract a package into a directory. If you do not specify
the destination directory, the package will be extracted
in the current directory using the name <tt><em>package-version</em></tt>:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg extract <em>package.tazpkg</em>
# tazpkg extract <em>package.tazpkg target/dir</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="pack">pack</h3>

<p>
The <tt>pack</tt> command will create a package from a directory
prepared in advance or from an unpacked package. It can 
also manually create a .tazpkg package (see the Cookutils documentation
for the automatic creation of packages). To pack a package:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg pack <em>package-version</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="repack">repack</h3>

<p>
The <tt>repack</tt> command allows you to recreate a package from
the files on a system where it was previously installed.
To repack a package:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg repack <tt>package</tt>
</pre>


<h3 id="repack-config">repack-config</h3>

<p>
The <tt>repack-config</tt> command recreates a package
of the system configuration files (see
<tt><a href="#list-config">list-config</a></tt>). It is enough 
to install the package to find the current configuration. To repack 
the configuration files:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg repack-config
</pre>


<h3 id="recharge">recharge</h3>

<p>
Recharge the list of available packages on the mirror. 
This command will download the most recent <tt>packages.list</tt>
of installable packages on the mirror and before starting 
will save the old list. Once the list is updated,
you can then use the <tt><a href="#list">list</a></tt> and
<tt><a href="#search">search</a></tt> commands. To view
and list the differences, you can use <code>list-mirror --diff</code>;
and to view and update packages, you can simply
<tt><a href="#upgrade">upgrade</a></tt>. To recharge the
latest list of packages:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg recharge
</pre>


<h3 id="upgrade">up or upgrade</h3>

<p>
Upgrade allows you to update all installed packages available
on the current mirror. Upgrading packages is an important
part of system security, it helps to keep you secure with
the latest updates and fixes. The SliTaz project,
although tiny, provides regular updates on security and generally
offers the latest versions of software. Note that this 
function is aimed at people with SliTaz installed on a 
hard drive. Updated packages in LiveCD mode will be lost on
system shutdown. To upgrade or display the full <tt>up</tt> options:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg up
# tazpkg --help-up
# tazpkg up --recharge --install
# tazpkg up -r -i
</pre>


<h3 id="check">check</h3>

<p>
The <tt>check</tt> command can check dependencies on installed
packages and determine whether all the files needed for the 
repacking of packages are present:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg check <em>package</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="block">block or unblock</h3>

<p>
The <tt>block</tt> and <tt>unblock</tt> commands permit you to block
installed package versions so that they are not maintained
by an <tt><a href="#upgrade">upgrade</a></tt>. The list of packages
on hold are contained
in the <tt>/var/lib/tazpkg/blocked-packages.list</tt>. This file can also
be edited by hand. To block or unblock a package such as
Grub:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg block <em>grub</em>
# tazpkg unblock <em>grub</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="get">get</h3>

<p>
Get a package from the mirror (if it exists). The downloaded
package is stored in the current directory. To find the path
you can use <code>pwd</code>. To get the Grub package:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg get <em>grub</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="get-install">get-install</h3>

<p>
Get and install a package from a mirror on the internet.
The <tt>get-install</tt> command begins by checking whether the
package exists on the mirror and if it has been already downloaded. 
For a list of packages on the mirror, we must
use the <tt><a href="#list-mirror">list-mirror</a></tt> command.
To install the package Grub:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg get-install <tt>grub</tt>
</pre>


<h3 id="clean-cache">clean-cache</h3>

<p>
Remove *.tazpkg packages downloaded to the cache. During 
installation, Tazpkg keeps a copy of packages downloaded
from the web. This is done to save bandwidth in case of 
reinstallation, but you may want to free up space on the hard
drive or re-download the packages:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg clean-cache
</pre>


<h3 id="setup-mirror">setup-mirror</h3>

<p>
Setup the URL for the mirror. The <tt>setup-mirror</tt> command
will ask for the URL of the new mirror. You can specify
multiple URLs separated by spaces. Note that you can also
modify the main <tt>/var/lib/tazpkg/mirror</tt> file. The URL must
point to the directory containing the <tt>packages.list</tt> and
packages:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg setup-mirror
</pre>


<h3 id="reconfigure">reconfigure</h3>

<p>
Replays the post-install script from the package.
Example using gcc:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg reconfigure <em>gcc</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="depends">depends or rdepends</h3>

<p>
Displays a dependency tree or reverse dependency tree for a package.
Examples using mpd:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg depends <em>mpd</em>
# tazpkg rdepends <em>mpd</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="add-undigest">add-undigest or setup-undigest</h3>

<p>
Set the URL of an additional unofficial mirror to test packages that
are not yet present on the official mirrors. Note, you can also
manually edit the file in <tt>/var/lib/tazpkg/undigest/<em>repository</em></tt>.
The URL must point to the directory containing the packages and
<tt>packages.list</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg add-undigest <em>public-repository http://my.home.org/slitaz</em>
# tazpkg setup-undigest <em>local-repository /home/slitaz/packages</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="remove-undigest">remove-undigest</h3>

<p>
Removes the URL of an undigest mirror:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg remove-undigest <em>my-repository</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="list-undigest">list-undigest</h3>

<p>
Lists additional undigest mirrors:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg list-undigest
</pre>


<h3 id="convert">convert</h3>

<p>
Converts a Debian package (.deb), Redhat (.rpm), Slackware (.tgz) or 
Archlinux (.pkg.tar.gz) package into a SliTaz package (.tazpkg):
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg convert <em>alien-package</em>
</pre>


<h3 id="set-release">set-release</h3>
<p>
The <tt>set-release</tt> command changes the current version and 
upgrades all of the packages to the latest release:
</p>
<pre>
# tazpkg set-release <em>cooking</em>
</pre>
